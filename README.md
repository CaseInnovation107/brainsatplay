## Getting Started <a name="getting-started" />
### Running a Local Server
1. Install [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. In the project folder, install the required Node modules by typing this into your command line:
```bash
npm install
``` 
3. In your command line:
```bash
npm start
```
4. Click on the link in the terminal to navigate to http://localhost to view a template project using the Brains@Play software library

### Stream Data into the Server
1. Use your favorite environment management system (e.g. [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)) to create a new environment.
2. Install the brainsatplay package
```bash
pip install brainsatplay
```
3. Navigate to this project's /libraries/python directory
4. In stream.py, configure the following settings for your specific use-case:
```python
BOARD = 'SYNTHETIC_BOARD' 
  # Synthetic Stream: 'SYNTHETIC_BOARD'
  # OpenBCI Board: 'CYTON_DAISY_BOARD'
  # Neurosity Boards: 'NOTION_1_BOARD' or 'NOTION_2_BOARD'

PORT = None
  # Synthetic Stream: None
  # Mac: '/dev/cu.usbserial-________'
  # Windows: 'COM_'
                
URL = 'http://localhost'
  # Local: 'http://localhost'
  # Deployed Game: 'https://brainsatplay.azurewebsites.net'

LOGIN_DATA = {
        'guestaccess': True, 
        'guestId': '********' 
    }
  # Guests: { 'guestaccess': True, 'guestId': '********'}
  # Authenticated Users: { 'username': '********', 'password': '********' }

GAME = 'template'
    # Current Games: template, brainstorm

ACCESS = 'public'
  # Anyone Can Access Data (required to play games): 'public'
  # Only Interfaces with Same USERID Access Data: 'private'

```
6. Begin streaming:
```bash
python stream.py
```

##  Examples
### [Brains@Play Project Template](https://brainsatplay.com/docs/examples/template) 
The Brains@Play Project Template uses p5.js to illustrate the basic functionality of the Brains@Play API. We include it in this repository for you to kickstart your game development! 

### [Brainstorm](https://brainsatplay.com/docs/examples/brainstorm) 

Brainstorm is a web-based BCI game that computes, visualizes, and promotes the synchronization of brains across geographic, political, and social barriers. To generate public discussion about the ethical, legal, and social implications of emerging commercial devices to monitor brain activity, Brainstorm will be showcased at [Livewire: A Stimulating Night of Neurotechnology](https://visionsandvoices.usc.edu/eventdetails/?event_id=33741435186601&s_type=&s_genre=)â€”a USC Visions and Voices event combining neuroscience, neuroethics, and interactive media for participatory technology design.
